### Issues with Flask-Testing.

_This section of the documentation covers my experience with the Flask-Testing module, why I ultimately chose to scrap the LiveServerTestCase class, and how I designed my own multi-threaded test framework._

Test_client() is a _lightweight browser emulation_ that comes prebuilt into flask. This makes it easier for developers to test their programs without having to write their own.
However, this client cannot _fully_ emulate the environment of an application running within a browser.

There are a number of things that it will **not** do. The test_client() browser cannot execute JavaScript code, which makes it impossible to fully test an interactive UI. 
Any code that is included within a http response will be returned without having been executed.

For this project, I wanted to ensure that my functional tests were running in a ‘true-to-life' production environment.

This is why I chose to run my functional tests on a use a real web browser, hat is connected to our application, running on a real web server. 

### UI Testing with Selenium.

Selenium is a web browser automation tool that supports the most popular web browsers, across Windows, MacOS and Linux.

>> Permission to name this testing framework the “Mi-Guel” test framework.
>> I found my solution after reading Miguel Grinberg’s Flask Web Development (2nd edition). 

Selenium requires a 'web driver' to run tests within a web browser.

>> Additional credit goes to the ‘GOAT’: TDD with Python (2nd edition), written by Harry J.W. Percival.
